I'm a biochemical engineering graduate from the University of São Paulo (Brazil) but a developer by heart, interested in all aspects of computer science, programming 🧑‍💻 and Engineering 👨‍🔬.
Currently developing solutions for the sugar cane 🌱 business with my partners at <a href="https://www.canac.com.br"><span>CANAC</span></a>.

<p align="justify">
I really enjoy programming all sorts things, from CLIs :fast_forward:, data processing pipelines 💽, microservices :cloud:, APIs :on:, mobile applications :iphone: and good old front-end applications :computer:.
I have a really deep passion for creating interactive data visualizations from absolute scratch, integrating data and visual storytelling has always been one of my favorite activities. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
As a manner of personal preference, I always prefer to go as far as possible to understand the abstractions that I use in a daily basis, always striving to understand more and more of the
capabilities we have in order to deliver the mosy useful and performant programs possible.
