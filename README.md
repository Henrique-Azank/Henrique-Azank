- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Henrique-Azank

 I'm a biochemical engineering graduate from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil), and I'm interested in all things Data Science and Engineering. 
 I'm really into using Machine Learning and Statistics in the field of Bioenginnering as a whole, not just bioinformatics. I believe that there is 
 a limitless source of Data in Bioengineering not being used in an efficient way. 
 
 I'm not limited on the Bioengineering though. I have developted projects in other unrelated fields, in areas such as Customer Succsess, Production 
 Engineering and Economics. I have a deep appreciation for Science as a whole whether it is biological, political, mechanical, sociological or economical
 in nature. In time, I look forward to developt applications/study cases in all of these fields. 
 
 I have experience with both Python and R for Data Science, but also developt applications using VBA and spreadsheet modelling. I also have a strong 
 statistics background, always going the extra mile when fitting models in order to fully understand exactly what they tell us. 
 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to share my work and collaborate with fellow Data Scientists in meaningful projects. I have a strong grasp 
in the statistics, math and Data Visualization, but lack knowlege in how to share my models in a "production" level.
